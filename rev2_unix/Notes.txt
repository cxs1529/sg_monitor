Renaming the parent directory breaks the virtual environment, so don't do it!

A) SETUP

1) Create a virtual environment to install required libraries locally 
	>> python3 -m venv .venv-sg
2) Activate virtual environment: 
	>> source ./venv-sg/bin/activate
2) "pip install requirements.txt" or "pip install" the following libraries:
pandas
Flask
Frozen-Flask
folium
netCDF4
numpy
plotly

B) RUN SCRIPTS

1) Edit the sgid_list.py file with the source directory containing the .nc files, and the list of seaglider IDs to process. 
	1.1) The source dir with .nc files should be located anywhere in phodnet, following the next steps.
	1.2) The files are first sent to the AOML FTP server using the .ftp file directive (basestation), into 
		"ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/incoming/aoml.glider/dataDir/sgNNN". Files in the incoming dir are deleted after 30 days.
	1.3) Copy the files from the AOML FTP into phodnet "/phodnet/share/aomlglider/GLIDER_DATA/rawData" (RAWDATA), by running 
		"RunBackup.sh" in a crontab. Make sure sgID list (GLIDERs_ids_use) and mission number (MISSION) are updated.
		This will be the source directory to read .nc files and create the database.

2) Run "make_db.py" to parse the .nc files and create am sqlite database.
3) Run "make_web.py" to read the database and generate the html files in the designated directory (websiteDir).
4) Run "send_website.py" to copy the webpage files to the desired public webserver directory.

C) All steps in (B) are compiled in RunGliderWeb.sh -> cd to this dir and run ./RunGliderWeb.sh
